== Building Block View


The building block view shows the static decomposition of our system into building blocks, as well as their inner dependencies. We will show different levels and zoom into black boxes to show their components.

It is all based on the scope and context diagram that has been described in the third section of the documentation.


=== Level 1

In the first level, we distribute the responsabilities of the system in the main application, which is Viade, and Solid Server.
