== Building Block View

****

The building block view shows the static decomposition of our system into building blocks, as well as their inner dependencies.

This section is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes and their descriptions, as we can see in the figure below.

*Level 1* 

In the first level, we can find the components, the model and the different services of the system, this is because we are using a MVC model, so this allow us to distribute the responsabilities of the system in different parts.

      * Login
      * Profile
      * Notifications management
      * Routes management
