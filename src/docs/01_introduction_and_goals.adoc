== Introduction and Goals

 
****
The goal of this project is to create Viade, which is a decentralized routes management system based on the Solid specifications.

Along this documentation, you will be able to find the prominent requirements of our project, quality goals for the software architecture and stakeholders with their specific interests.

=== Requirements Overview



[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Requirement|Description
| Decentralized architecture | The application will be separated from the data storage
|Routes | User can store their routes in their own PODs. 
|Map | User can view their routes, added to the POD, stored on a map.
|Shared files |  Pictures, videos or information about a route can be shared with user friends.
|Notifications | When some friend of our user shares a route with him, he can get notifications.
|Group of friends| Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route. 
|Interoperability| It should be possible to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app.

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Goal|Motivation|Importance
| Usability | One of the most important is that it is esay to use by de user  |  High
| Efficiency|  If the user is waiting for a long time for response, the people won't use it | High
| Functionality | The ability to perform a task or function is obviously  very important too | High
| Reliability-Security | Users need to trust the app and the correct data that they introduce and its decentralization to use it  | Medium-High

=== Stakeholders

|===
|Role|Description and Goals
| Developers | The members team that develop the app and that they need to pass the ASW subject 
| Users |  People who are interested in using the decentraliced app for save their routes and share it with their friends
| The Inrupt Company |  The enterprise that created Solid will value us as if it were a teacher to give a diploma to the winning team members 
| Professors | Our lecture and practical Teachers and also, Coordinator of the Software Architecture. To see their students are able to investigate and develop a new project, so that they can be prepare for the future
