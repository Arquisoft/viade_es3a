=== Domain model

 * It is a conceptual model of all issues related to a specific problem. In our case, our domain model covers four things:

** Routes
** User (save the routes)
** Google Maps (shows the routes in a map)
** Friend (receives the route that you send him/her)

=== User Experience

This is a routes management system and its meant to allow several people to save, see and share their routes easily. User interface must be friendly and accessible so all kind of user profiles can use the application without any impediment or difficulty.

=== Safety and security

Itâ€™s important to preserve the privacy of the data and the security of the user during the usage and the not usage of Viade.

=== Privacy

The most important concept about the project, Privacy. When you use an app that uses SOLID specs and personal PODs where the user save his/her data and, in this way, only this user is the owner of his data and not an enterprise/business that trade with this.
