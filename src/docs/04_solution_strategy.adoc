== Solution Strategy

=== Decisions
The following list shows some decisions we have made to develop this project.

* Use of *https://solid.inrupt.com/[SOLID]* to save personal user's routes in the application. User will be able to decide which data wants to store and who has access to it. SOLID's main advantage is that it will allow us to have a completely descentralized application and fully under user's controll using PODS.

* We decided to use *https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript[JavaScript]* to develop this program, because it's easier to use with SOLID and create web applications. Also, we need to use *https://facebook.github.io/react-native/[React Native]* for this subject, a JavaScript library that lets you build web applications or mobile apps.

* We will use *https://nodejs.org/es/[Node.js]*, an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime what ables to build scalable network applications. It is compatible with SOLID an they explain how to use it to run your server quickly.

* At the beginning of the project we wanted to use *https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform?hl=es[Google Maps API]*, but later we decided to use *https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:P%C3%A1gina_principal[Open Street Map]* with *https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet]*, an open source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, because Google Maps allows you to send a specific number of free requests and later you have to pay to keep using the API. 

* For data exchange and storage we decided to used *https://geojson.org/[GeoJSON]*, an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features that we consider easier to manipulate than other formats like XML.
